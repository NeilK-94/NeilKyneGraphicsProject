<h1>Dodge</h1>
<i>Neil Kyne</i>
A graphics project by Neil Kyne. The aim of the game is to avoid the enemy balls by controlling your ball using the arrow keys!
Three enemy balls are loaded in at random spots in the canvas. If you collide with any of them you lose!

The controls for Dodge are very simple, simpy use the arrow keys to go the direction you want (left, righ, up, down).

If you do lose by hitting an enemyball you can restart the game by simply clicking 'Enter'

Enjoy1 :)
